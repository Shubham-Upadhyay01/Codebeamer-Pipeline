Feature: System Integration and Interoperability

  As a system administrator, I want the medical device to integrate seamlessly with hospital systems
  so that clinical workflows are efficient and data flows smoothly between systems

  Background:
    Given the medical device system is operational
    And integration interfaces are configured
    And target systems are available for communication

  @dicom @integration @critical
  Scenario: DICOM Image Transmission
    Given a DICOM image needs to be transmitted
    And the receiving DICOM node is available
    When the image transmission is initiated
    Then the image should be successfully transmitted
    And DICOM compliance should be maintained
    And transmission logs should be recorded
    And error handling should manage transmission failures

  @hl7 @integration @data-exchange
  Scenario: HL7 Message Processing
    Given an HL7 message is received from the HIS/RIS system
    When the message is processed by the integration engine
    Then the message should be parsed correctly
    And data should be extracted and validated
    And acknowledgment should be sent to the source system
    And processing status should be logged

  @api @integration @real-time
  Scenario: Real-time API Data Synchronization
    Given external systems are connected via APIs
    When data changes occur in the source system
    Then updates should be synchronized within 30 seconds
    And data consistency should be maintained
    And sync conflicts should be detected and resolved
    And API rate limits should be respected

  @pacs @integration @storage
  Scenario: PACS Integration for Image Storage
    Given medical images need to be stored
    And the PACS system is available
    When images are sent to PACS for storage
    Then images should be stored with proper metadata
    And storage confirmation should be received
    And image retrieval should be validated
    And storage compliance should be maintained

  @database @integration @synchronization
  Scenario: Database Integration and Replication
    Given multiple databases need to stay synchronized
    When data updates occur in the primary database
    Then changes should replicate to secondary databases
    And data integrity should be maintained across all instances
    And replication lag should be monitored
    And conflict resolution should handle simultaneous updates

  @monitoring @integration @health-check
  Scenario: Integration Health Monitoring
    Given multiple systems are integrated
    When the integration monitoring system runs
    Then connectivity status should be checked for all endpoints
    And performance metrics should be collected
    And alerts should be generated for failed connections
    And health dashboards should display current status

  @failover @integration @reliability
  Scenario: Integration Failover and Recovery
    Given primary integration endpoints become unavailable
    When a system failure is detected
    Then failover to secondary endpoints should occur automatically
    And data queuing should prevent message loss
    And recovery procedures should restore normal operations
    And incident notifications should be sent to administrators

  @security @integration @compliance
  Scenario: Secure Integration Communications
    Given sensitive data is exchanged between systems
    When integration communications occur
    Then all data transmissions should be encrypted
    And authentication should be required for all connections
    And audit logs should track all integration activities
    And compliance with security standards should be maintained
