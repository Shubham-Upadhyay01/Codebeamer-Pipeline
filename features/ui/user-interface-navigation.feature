  As a healthcare professional, I want an intuitive and efficient user interface
  so that I can quickly navigate the system and focus on patient care

  Background:
    Given the user is logged into the medical device system
    And the main dashboard is displayed
    And all UI components are properly loaded

  @navigation @smoke @ui
  Scenario: Main Menu Navigation
    Given the user is on the main dashboard
    When the user clicks on main menu items
    Then the corresponding modules should load within 3 seconds
    And the navigation breadcrumb should update correctly
    And the active menu item should be visually highlighted
    And the page title should reflect the current section

  @ui @accessibility @compliance
  Scenario: Accessibility Compliance
    Given the user interface is loaded
    When the user navigates using keyboard shortcuts
    Then all interactive elements should be accessible via keyboard
    And screen reader compatibility should be maintained
    And color contrast should meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
    And font sizes should be adjustable for visual impairment

  @ui @responsive @mobile
  Scenario: Responsive Design Validation
    Given the interface is accessed on different screen sizes
    When the screen resolution changes
    Then the layout should adapt appropriately
    And all functionality should remain accessible
    And text should remain readable
    And touch targets should be appropriately sized for mobile devices

  @ui @workflow @efficiency
  Scenario: Workflow Optimization
    Given the user needs to complete a common clinical workflow
    When the user follows the standard process
    Then the number of clicks should be minimized
    And contextual information should be readily available
    And the user should receive clear feedback on actions
    And progress indicators should show workflow status

  @ui @error-handling @usability
  Scenario: User-Friendly Error Messages
    Given the user encounters a system error
    When an error occurs during operation
    Then the error message should be clear and actionable
    And technical jargon should be avoided
    And suggested solutions should be provided
    And error recovery options should be available

  @ui @customization @user-preference
  Scenario: User Interface Customization
    Given the user wants to personalize their workspace
    When the user accesses customization settings
    Then layout preferences should be configurable
    And display options should be adjustable
    And custom settings should be saved per user
    And default settings should be easily restorable

  @performance @ui @nfr
  Scenario: UI Performance Requirements
    Given the user is interacting with the interface
    When any UI action is performed
    Then page load times should be under 3 seconds
    And UI responsiveness should be maintained under load
    And animations should be smooth and not interfere with workflow
    And system resource usage should be optimized
