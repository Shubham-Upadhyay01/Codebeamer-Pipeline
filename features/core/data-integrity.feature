Feature: Data Integrity and Audit Trail

  As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity throughout the system
  so that patient data remains accurate, complete, and traceable for regulatory compliance

  Background:
    Given the medical device system is operational
    And data integrity mechanisms are enabled
    And audit logging is configured and active

  @data @validation @critical
  Scenario: Data Input Validation
    Given the user is entering patient data
    When invalid or incomplete data is submitted
    Then the system should reject the invalid data
    And appropriate validation error messages should be displayed
    And the user should be guided to correct the data
    And the validation attempt should be logged

  @audit @compliance @critical
  Scenario: Complete Audit Trail for Data Changes
    Given the user has appropriate permissions to modify data
    When the user makes changes to patient data
    Then the system should record the original value
    And the new value should be recorded
    And the user making the change should be logged
    And the timestamp of the change should be recorded
    And the reason for change should be captured if required

  @data @backup @recovery
  Scenario: Data Backup and Recovery Verification
    Given the system performs regular data backups
    When a data recovery operation is needed
    Then the backup data should be complete and uncorrupted
    And the recovery process should maintain data integrity
    And the recovery operation should be logged
    And data verification checks should confirm successful recovery

  @security @encryption @data
  Scenario: Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit
    Given sensitive patient data is stored in the system
    When data is stored or transmitted
    Then all sensitive data should be encrypted
    And encryption keys should be properly managed
    And data access should require proper decryption
    And encryption/decryption events should be logged

  @data @synchronization @integration
  Scenario: Data Synchronization Integrity
    Given the system integrates with external systems
    When data is synchronized between systems
    Then data consistency should be maintained across all systems
    And synchronization conflicts should be detected and resolved
    And sync operations should be logged with success/failure status
    And data checksums should verify integrity

  @performance @data @nfr
  Scenario: Data Performance and Availability
    Given the system is under normal operating load
    When users access patient data
    Then data retrieval should complete within 2 seconds
    And the system should maintain 99.9% data availability
    And performance metrics should be monitored and logged
    And alerts should be generated for performance degradation

  @compliance @retention @data
  Scenario: Data Retention and Archival
    Given patient data has reached its retention period
    When the retention policy is applied
    Then data should be archived according to regulatory requirements
    And archived data should remain accessible for the required period
    And data disposal should be secure and logged
    And compliance reports should be generated
